The three main types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma. BCC and SCC are also called non-melanoma skin cancer or keratinocyte cancer. They are far more common than melanoma. Rare types of non-melanoma skin cancer include Merkel cell carcinoma and angiosarcoma.
