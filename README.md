# Introduction and Background
Skin cancer, out-of-control growth of abnormal cells in the *epidermis*, the outermost skin layer, is one of the most wide-spread cancer found in global population. These mutations lead the skin cells to multiply rapidly and <b>form malignant tumors. The main types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), *melanoma* and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Among all the skin cancer type, melanoma is the least common skin cancer, but it is responsible for **75%** of death [SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification, 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification).
