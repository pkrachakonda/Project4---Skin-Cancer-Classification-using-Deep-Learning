# Project4_Gr12
# Skin Cancer Classification using Deep Learning

# Introduction and Background
Skin cancer, out-of-control growth of abnormal cells in the *epidermis*, the outermost skin layer, is one of the most wide-spread cancer found in global population. These mutations lead the skin cells to multiply rapidly and <b>form malignant tumors. The main types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), *melanoma* and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Among all the skin cancer type, melanoma is the least common skin cancer, but it is responsible for **75%** of death [SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification, 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification).

What is it? *Melanoma is a cancer that develops from melanocytes, the skin cells that produce melanin pigment, which gives skin its color.*

Where is it usually found? *Melanomas often resemble moles and sometimes may arise from them. They can be found on any area of the body, even in areas that are not typically exposed to the sun.*

How many people get it? *In 2023, more than ... ,new cases of melanoma are expected to occur in Australia., about .... of which will be invasive.*

How serious is it? *Melanoma is the most dangerous of the three most common forms of skin cancer. Melanomas can be curable when caught and treated early. In 2023, melanoma is projected to cause about .... deaths.*
    
# Objective of the Project
The overarching goal is to support the efforts to reduce the death caused by skin cancer. This project aims to develop a predictive using **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesions images. The improved accuracy and efficiency of the model can aid to detect melanoma in the early stages and can help to reduce unnecessary deaths
