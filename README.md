<h3>1.1. A quick recap': what cancer actually is...</h3>

<p>Cancer is the name given to a <b>collection of related diseases</b>. In all types of cancer, some of the bodyâ€™s cells begin to <b>divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues</b>. Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them.<br>
